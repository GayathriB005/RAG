## Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for Question Answering (QA) tasks. The system enables users to ask questions and retrieve accurate, context-aware answers from a collection of AI research papers. The approach combines document retrieval with language generation to improve the quality of responses.

### Key Features
- Document preprocessing: Load, chunk, and vectorize research papers.
- Retrieval system: Efficiently retrieves relevant information based on user queries.
- Answer generation: Integrates a language model to provide coherent answers.
- Source attribution: References the correct sections of the research papers for transparency.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-qa-system.git
   cd rag-qa-system
